# README-Generator

Description 

This is a node.js command-line application that can quickly create a professional README for a new project using a series of prompt questions about the project. This application solely uses javascript, node.js, and the inquirer package. 

Users generate a README file with the following sections: the title of my project, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions with links to email and GitHub repository.
